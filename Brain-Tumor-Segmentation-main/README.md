## 🧠 **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to propose a lightweight U-Net model to:  
1. Accurately segment brain tumors in pre- and post-operative MRI images.  
2. Visualize different slices of MRI images by manipulating the coordinates.  
3. Evaluate segmentation performance using key metrics like IoU and pixel accuracy.

  - Filter sizes:  
    - **Encoder**: 128×128 → 64×64 → 32×32 → 16×16 → 8×8  
    - **Decoder**: 8×8 → 16×16 → 32×32 → 64×64 → 128×128  
- **Activation Function**: ReLU.  
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.0001.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Pixel Accuracy.  
  - Mean Accuracy.  
  - Mean IoU.  
  - Frequency Weighted IoU (FWIoU).
